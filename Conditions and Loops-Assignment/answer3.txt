Loops:-
Loops are used when we want to perform repeated actions. if we want to run the same code over and over, each time with a different value. 

Example:- if there is a task of printing numbers from 1 to 100, it will be very hectic or difficult to do it manually, loops helps us to automate such tasks.

Types of Loops:-
(1)- For loop:- loop a block of code a number of times.
(2)- for-in loop:- loop through the properties of an object.
(3)- for-of loop:- loops through the values of an iterable object.
(4)- while loop:- loops a block based on a specific condition.
(5)- do-while loop:- while loop varient which runs atleast once.

[1]- For loop:- 
    for(declaration ;condition; increment/decrement){
       // body to execute
    }

 Example:- 
        let num2=25;
        for(let num1=10; num1<=num2;num1++){
        console.log(num1);
        }   

[2]- for-in loop:-
      for (key in object) {
  // body to execute
}

Example:- 
            const person = {firstName:"amit", lastName:"kumar", age:20};
            let text = "";
            for (let x in person) {
            text += person[x];
            }


[3]- for-of loop:-
            for (variable of iterable) {
            // body to be executed
            }

Example:-   
            const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
            let text = "";
            for (let x of cars) {
            text += x;
            }

[4]- while loop:-
    while (condition) {
    // body
}

Example:- 
        let a=1;
        while (a<=25) {
        console.log(a);
        a++;
        }

[5]- do-while loop:-
        do {
             // body to execute
        } while (condition);

Example:- 
        let c=5;
        do {
        console.log(c);
        c++;
        }while (c<=2);
